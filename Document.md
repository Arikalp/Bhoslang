# 🚀 Bhoslang — Official Documentation (Serious Tech… with Questionable Naming 😌)

Welcome to **Bhoslang** — a lightweight, beginner-friendly programming language designed to make learning interpreters fun.

If you know basic logic and can type without fear…
**Congratulations — you are already overqualified.** 🎉

---

# 🧠 What Bhoslang Can Do (Phase 1)

Your language currently supports:

✅ Creating variables
✅ Updating variables
✅ Printing values
✅ Performing math (+ − * /)
✅ Looking suspiciously professional 😎

---

# 📜 Ground Rules (Read or Regret)

Before you start coding like a legend:

* 🔹 Write **one command per line**
* 🔹 Spaces between tokens are REQUIRED (this is not Python magic)
* 🔹 Keywords are **case-sensitive**
* 🔹 Declare variables before using them (trust me on this)

# 🔥 COMMANDS REFERENCE

---

## 🟢 `bsdk` — Create a Variable

> Use this when you want the computer to remember something.

### 🧾 Syntax

```
bsdk <variable> = <value>
```

### ✅ Examples

```
bsdk x = 10
bsdk score = 99
```

### 🧠 What Actually Happens

You politely tell memory:

> “Hey, keep this safe. I’ll need it later.”

---

## 🟡 `badalbsdk` — Update a Variable

> Because change is the only constant (and bugs).

### 🧾 Syntax

```
badalbsdk <variable> = <expression>
```

### ✅ Examples

```
badalbsdk x = 20
badalbsdk x = x + 5
badalbsdk score = score * 2
```

### 🧠 What It Means

You’re saying:

> “Forget the old value. We’re upgrading.”

---

## 🔵 `likhbsdk` — Print a Variable

> The “just show me the value” command.

### 🧾 Syntax

```
likhbsdk <variable>
```

### ✅ Example

```
bsdk x = 10
likhbsdk x
```

### 🖥️ Output

```
10
```

Nice. Clean. No drama.

---

## 🟣 `batabsdk` — Print an Expression

> When you don’t trust your mental math.

### 🧾 Syntax

```
batabsdk <value> <operator> <value>
```

### ✅ Examples

```
batabsdk x + y
batabsdk x * y
batabsdk 10 - 3
batabsdk 20 / 5
```

### 🧠 Translation

You’re basically saying:

> “Dear computer, please be my calculator.”

---

# 🧮 Supported Operators

| Operator | What it does   | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `+`      | Addition       | `x + y` |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `x - y` |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `x * y` |
| `/`      | Division       | `x / y` |

Yes, we kept the math civilised.

---

# 🎬 Complete Example Program

Copy this into `sample.my` and feel powerful:

```
bsdk x = 10
bsdk y = 5

likhbsdk x
batabsdk x + y
batabsdk x * y

badalbsdk x = x + y
likhbsdk x
```

---

# 🖥️ Expected Output

```
10
15
50
15
```

If you see this output…

> 🏆 Congratulations. You are now officially a **Bhoslang developer**.

Please try to stay humble.

# ⚠️ Current Limitations (a.k.a. Things That Will Break Your Heart)

Right now the language is intentionally simple:

❌ No strings
❌ No parentheses
❌ No if/else
❌ No loops
❌ Error messages are… optimistic

But don’t worry — upgrades are inevitable.

# 🛣️ Roadmap (Where This Madness Is Going)

Future versions may include:

* 🔥 `agarbsdk` (if/else)
* 🔥 `jabtakbsdk` (loops)
* 🔥 string support
* 🔥 functions
* 🔥 VS Code syntax highlighting
* 🔥 possibly world domination 🌍

---

# 🤝 Contributing

Want to make **Bhoslang** even better?

You can:

* Improve the tokenizer
* Add new commands
* Strengthen the parser
* Make the interpreter faster
* Or just rename things more creatively 😏

Pull requests welcome.

Judgment optional.

# 🎉 Final Words

Write code.
Break things.
Fix them.
Repeat.

And remember:

**Every great programming language starts with one slightly questionable keyword.** 🚀
