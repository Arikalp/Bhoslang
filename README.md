# 🔥 Bhoslang - Because Regular Programming Languages Are Too Mainstream

![Bhoslang Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bhoslang-Pro%20Edition-00ff41?style=for-the-badge&logo=data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQiIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj4KPHBhdGggZD0iTTEyIDJMMTMuMDkgOC4yNkwyMCA5TDEzLjA5IDE1Ljc0TDEyIDIyTDEwLjkxIDE1Ljc0TDQgOUwxMC45MSA4LjI2TDEyIDJaIiBmaWxsPSIjMDBmZjQxIi8+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=)

> **Warning**: May cause spontaneous laughter, questionable life choices, and an uncontrollable urge to name everything with "bsdk"

## 🎭 What Even Is This Madness?

Bhoslang is what happens when you combine:
- 🇮🇳 Indian street slang ("bsdk" = "behenchod")
- 💻 Programming language fundamentals
- 😂 Questionable naming conventions
- 🔥 A burning desire to make programming fun again

It's a beginner-friendly interpreted language that proves you don't need fancy syntax to build something awesome. Or at least... something.

## 🚀 Features That Will Make Your Computer Question Its Existence

### ✅ **Currently Working (Mostly)**
- **Variable Declaration** - `bsdk x = 42` (because variables need existential validation)
- **Variable Updates** - `badalbsdk x = x + 1` (change is the only constant)
- **Printing Values** - `likhbsdk x` (shout your variables to the world)
- **Math Operations** - `batabsdk x + y` (when calculator apps are too mainstream)
- **Help System** - `madadbsdk` (for when you forget everything)

### ❌ **Currently Broken (Read: Future Features)**
- Strings (who needs words when you have numbers?)
- Loops (circular logic is overrated)
- Functions (copy-paste is the original function)
- Error handling (errors are just unexpected features)
- Arrays (lists are for organized people)

## 🎮 How to Run This Glorious Creation

### **Option 1: The Terminal Experience**
```bash
node repl.js
# Prepare for terminal glory
```

### **Option 2: The Web Experience**
```bash
# Open index.html in your browser
# Experience the future of questionable programming
```

### **Option 3: File Execution**
```bash
node index.js examples/sample.bsdk
# Run files like it's 1995
```

## 📚 The Sacred Commands (Memorize or Perish)

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `bsdk` | Creates a variable (gives it life) | `bsdk x = 10` |
| `badalbsdk` | Updates a variable (mid-life crisis) | `badalbsdk x = x + 5` |
| `likhbsdk` | Prints a variable (show-off mode) | `likhbsdk x` |
| `batabsdk` | Prints math results (calculator mode) | `batabsdk x * 2` |
| `madadbsdk` | Shows help (when you're lost) | `madadbsdk` |

## 🎬 A Complete Program That Does... Something

```bsdk
bsdk x = 10
bsdk y = 5

likhbsdk x
batabsdk x + y
batabsdk x * y

badalbsdk x = x + y
likhbsdk x
```

**Output:**
```
10
15
50
15
```

*See? It's like magic, but with more questionable choices!*

## 🏗️ Architecture (Or: How We Built This Beautiful Monster)

```
Bhoslang/
├── src/
│   ├── lexer/tokenizer.js    # Turns your code into tiny pieces
│   ├── parser/parser.js      # Makes sense of the chaos
│   └── interpreter/          # Executes your beautiful madness
├── web/                      # Because everything needs a web version
├── examples/                 # Proof that it actually works
├── repl.js                   # Terminal experience
└── index.js                  # File execution
```

### **The Three Pillars of Questionable Design**

1. **Tokenizer** - Splits your code into tokens like a ninja with ADHD
2. **Parser** - Creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (sounds fancy, isn't)
3. **Interpreter** - Actually runs your code (the magic part)

## 🤔 Why Should You Use This?

### **Legitimate Reasons (We Think)**
- 📚 **Learning Tool** - Perfect for understanding how interpreters work
- 🎯 **Simple Syntax** - Easier than learning actual programming
- 😂 **Entertainment Value** - Your friends will question your sanity
- 🇮🇳 **Cultural Representation** - Because diversity in programming is important

### **Questionable Reasons (The Real Truth)**
- 🏆 **Bragging Rights** - "I code in Bhoslang"
- 💼 **Resume Builder** - Stands out from the crowd
- 🎪 **Party Trick** - Impress people with your weird skills
- 🔥 **Because You Can** - The best reason of all

## 🛣️ Roadmap (Or: How We Plan to Make It Even Weirder)

### **Phase 2: The Madness Continues**
- [ ] `agarbsdk` (if/else statements - because decisions are hard)
- [ ] `jabtakbsdk` (loops - for when you like doing things repeatedly)
- [ ] String support (words are cool too, we guess)
- [ ] Functions (proper code reuse, finally)
- [ ] Better error messages (less cryptic, more sassy)

### **Phase 3: World Domination**
- [ ] VS Code extension (syntax highlighting for the brave)
- [ ] Package manager (because every language needs one)
- [ ] Community (find other people who made questionable choices)
- [ ] Enterprise edition (for corporate masochism)

## 🤝 Contributing (Join The Cult)

Want to make Bhoslang even more ridiculous? Here's how:

1. **Fork this repository** (like a trident, but for code)
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/add-more-bsdk`)
3. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m "Added questionable feature"`)
4. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/add-more-bsdk`)
5. **Open a Pull Request** (prepare for judgment)

### **Areas That Need Love (And Code)**
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes** - Find and destroy the gremlins
- ✨ **New Features** - Add more questionable commands
- 📖 **Documentation** - Make it even more humorous
- 🎨 **UI/UX** - Make it prettier (if possible)
- 🧪 **Tests** - Because even ridiculous code needs testing

## 🎭 Final Words

Bhoslang started as a joke, became a learning project, and evolved into something that makes us question our life choices daily.

It's terrible, it's beautiful, it's ours.

**Remember:** Every great programming language starts with one slightly questionable keyword.
